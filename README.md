# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction – Kaggle Challenge

A classic introductory data science project focused on building a machine learning model to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the [Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) competition. It serves as a beginner-friendly problem to practice data analysis, feature engineering, and classification modeling.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict passenger survival using machine learning
- Apply data cleaning and preprocessing techniques
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Train and evaluate classification models using scikit-learn
- Gain practical experience in Python, pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## 🔍 Project Steps

### 1. Data Loading & Inspection
- Load and explore the dataset
- Identify missing values and data types

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Fill missing values (e.g., Age, Embarked)
- Encode categorical features (`Sex`, `Embarked`)
- Drop unnecessary columns (`Cabin`, `Name`, etc.)

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize distributions and relationships (e.g., survival vs. sex/class)
- Use count plots and bar charts to find survival trends

### 4. Model Building
- Feature selection: `Pclass`, `Sex`, and more
- Split dataset into training and test sets
- Train a Logistic Regression classifier

### 5. Evaluation
- Predict outcomes and assess performance
- Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

### 6. Final Prediction
- Build a simple prediction function for new data
- Output whether a passenger is predicted to survive

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Gained end-to-end exposure to the data science workflow
- Improved understanding of data preprocessing and modeling
- Strengthened foundational skills in Python and machine learning
